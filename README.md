# New Carrollton Data Dashboard (Phase II)
## Group Members: Brendan Conners, Anthony Lopez, Javier Oyola, and Ben Lintjewas

## Overview
For this Project, We were tasked with taking data from the city of New Carrollton, in the form of CSV files, and visualizing it so that the residents could see what is going on in the city itself and where they are spending money so that there is full transparency between government and residents. We were tasked with doing departments of the city including Financial, Public Works, and Code enforcement. They also encouraged our group to use Tableau, as that is what the previous semester had worked on and it worked well for them. Later throughout the semester they also asked us to include Documentation for a users Manual, so that they can go back and update/create new visualizations and do not have to rely on students to do so.

After getting our requirements, we found that we also needed to clean the data first, as the data came in with `null values` and incomplete reports, as well as misspelled street names and areas, and so to fix that we had to first use `OpenRefine` to clean the data, after that we were able to put the clean CSV files into a viz on Tableau

## Key Objectives

## Methodology
To meet project goals, we followed a strict schedule, starting each week by outlining tasks, such as working on sprints, updating our Jira board, and meeting with the client. When we faced delays due to missing data, we brainstormed alternatives, including searching for public data and exploring a new police dashboard. The City of New Carrollton emphasized transparency, prompting us to focus on data visualization.

Anthony and Javier, with expertise in Tableau, took the lead on the dashboard. Our task was to create a dashboard for multiple city departments, but after two weeks of waiting for the promised data, communication issues stalled progress. Eventually, the Mayor provided updated police data, leading us to adjust our scope to focus on police data.

We then cleaned the data using OpenRefine to address null values, misspelled streets, and incomplete reports. After months of delays, we secured a meeting in late November where we received the remaining data, excluding financial data, which we later obtained. During the meeting, we also discussed the need for a User Documentation Manual to enable future updates and visualizations without student involvement. Ultimately, we delivered a functional dashboard that met the City's goal of transparency and user accessibility.
