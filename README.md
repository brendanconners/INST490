# New Carrollton Data Dashboard (Phase II)
## Group Members: Brendan Conners, Anthony Lopez, Javier Oyola, and Ben Lintjewas

## Overview
For this Project, We were tasked with taking data from the city of New Carrollton, in the form of CSV files, and visualizing it so that the residents could see what is going on in the city itself and where they are spending money so that there is full transparency between government and residents. We were tasked with doing departments of the city including Financial, Public Works, and Code enforcement. They also encouraged our group to use Tableau, as that is what the previous semester had worked on and it worked well for them. Later throughout the semester they also asked us to include Documentation for a users Manual, so that they can go back and update/create new visualizations and do not have to rely on students to do so.
